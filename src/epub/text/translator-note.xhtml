			<h2 epub:type="title">Translator’s Preface</h2>
			<p>It was by a fortunate accident that the privilege of translating into English, for <i epub:type="se:name.publication.journal">Young India</i>, the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Story of My Experiments with Truth</i>, or Gandhiji’s Autobiography, as it was being published in <i epub:type="se:name.publication.journal">Navajivan</i> from week to week, fell to me. No one, perhaps, is more conscious of the blemishes in the translation than myself. But it might be some comfort to the reader to know that the volume, in the form in which it now appears, has had, so far as the meaning of the author is concerned, the benefit of his own careful revision, and so far as the language is concerned, the advantage of equally careful revision by Shrimati Miraben (Miss Madeleine Slade), who cast in her lot with us at the Ashram a year and a half ago.</p>
